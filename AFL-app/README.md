I built a mobile AFL data prototype inspired by <a href="https://afltables.com/afl/afl_index.html">AFL Tables</a> with limited functionality. A project to practice Sinatra, Ruby, Postgres and writing CSS/HTML for mobile first. Read more what I learnt <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/afl_mob/">here</a> or have a play with it <a href="http://afl-tables-mob.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. It is definitely best viewed on mobile.
